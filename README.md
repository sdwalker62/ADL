# How To Contribute

We are open to members of the open source community contributing to the project. The master branch will be protected and we will require approval from a project member to merge pull request. All open issues will be reviewed and solutions incorporated into each release. If you wish to help solve any of the open issues, please create a branch with the issue name and then open a PR when you are ready to merge. We will inspect the code and merge if it passes our unit and integration tests. The corresponding issue will then be closed.

We use development containers to package all dev dependencies. This makes it easy for new members to gather all dependencies at once. We will provide an updated dev container with each release. If your branch requires a new dependency to work, please note that in the pull request and we will update the dev container once the PR is merged. More information on dev containers will be listed below:
